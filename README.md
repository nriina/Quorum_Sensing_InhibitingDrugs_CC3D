This is an agent based simulation of bacterial quorum sensing using CompuCell3D. The simulation itself can be run locally with CompuCell3D using only the .cc3d file in main alongside the Simulation folder. The model is also currently avalible to use on nanohub.org at https://nanohub.org/tools/cc3dqsid/status.

The code is mostly python and xml, with global parameters explained at the top. There are also exercises to demonstrate the use of the model avalible on the nanohub webpage.

The code was developed by Nicholas Riina and Logan Geyman with CompuCell3D instruction and guidance from Dr. James Glazier and Juliano Ferrari.
